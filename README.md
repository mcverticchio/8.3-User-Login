## 8 3 UserLogin
Description: 
A very basic user login form that actually logs in a user and allows them to access protected resources.
This assignment allowed  me to use built in Parse User Auth (email & password), employ localstorage to keep the user 
logged in between requests, and set AJAX Headers.

Tech: HTML/CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Backbone, React, Parse, AJAX/JSON.
